# AgriSenseAI – KishanMitra: AI-powered Farm Assistant

Empowering Farmers with AI-driven Insights

---

## Introduction & Motivation

Agriculture is the backbone of India’s economy, yet farmers face challenges like unpredictable weather, volatile market prices, and limited access to timely information. **AgriSenseAI (KishanMitra)** is an AI-powered digital assistant designed to empower farmers, agronomists, and researchers with actionable, localized, and data-backed intelligence. The system leverages large language models (LLMs), vector search, and real-time APIs to provide:

- **Crop recommendations** tailored to soil and weather conditions.
- **Market price trend analysis** to suggest the best time to sell commodities.
- **Weather and soil data integration** for adaptive farm practices.
- **Conversational query answering** in simple language.

---

## System Architecture

AgriSenseAI is modular and scalable, consisting of three core layers:

### 1. Frontend (ReactJS)
- User-friendly web interface with CSV/PDF upload.
- Interactive chat for natural language queries.
- Displays crop recommendations, market trends, and weather forecasts.

### 2. Backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn)
- REST APIs for ingestion, query answering, and chat history.
- Handles file parsing, embedding, and vector search.
- Integrates external data sources and manages user sessions.

### 3. Data Management & Intelligence Layer
- **ChromaDB** for storing embeddings and semantic retrieval.
- **LLMs** (Hugging Face/OpenAI) for generating responses with external context.
- **External APIs** for weather (Weatherbit), soil (Agro Monitoring), and market data.

#### Data Flow

1. **User Query:** Farmer asks a question (e.g., “How much irrigation should I give my wheat crop this week?”).
2. **Location Permission:** System requests location for region-specific answers.
3. **Ingestion & Vectorization:** Uploaded files are vectorized and stored in ChromaDB.
4. **Context Retrieval:** Backend fetches relevant documents from ChromaDB.
5. **External Data Fetching:** Real-time weather, soil, and market data are retrieved via APIs.
6. **LLM Reasoning:** All context is combined and sent to the LLM for a personalized answer.
7. **Response Delivery & Storage:** Answer is shown in chat and saved in history.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) account for embeddings

---

## Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd AgriSense
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.envSample` to `.env` in the `backend/` folder.
   - Fill in your API keys:
     ```

      GROQ_API_KEY=your groq api key
      WEATHER_API_KEY=cab3be2a205d856f3504032be92d0522
      AGRO_API_KEY=00397c779310a78463e1b09b502ce32f
      WEATHERBIT_KEY=b77e8de87e4e4d2795df2760e5aeec56
      OPENCAGE_KEY=b2bba873d07349ddb7193f3abc1de3a5
     ```

5. **Add your CSV and PDF files:**
   - Place CSV files in `backend/data_csv/`
   - Place PDF files in `backend/data_pdf/`

6. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

## Market Data Setup (`agrimarket`)

The `agrimarket` folder contains scripts and data for agricultural market prices scraped from the official government portal.

- **CommodityAndCommodityHeads.csv:** Contains commodity codes for all of India(Do not chane this).
- **FullScrape.py:** Scrapes the latest 45 days of market data from the government site. Run this once to initialize or refresh the entire market database.
- **DailyUpdate.py:** Checks which days are missing in the latest 45 days and fetches only the missing data. Use this to keep your market data up to date.

**To update market data:**

```bash
cd agrimarket

# To fetch the latest 45 days of data (run once or when you want a full refresh)
python FullScrape.py

# To fetch only missing days in the latest 45 days (recommended for daily updates)
python DailyUpdate.py
```

> **Note:** The market data is stored in `backend/agri_market.db` as configured in `agrimarket/.env`.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Access the app:**
