Haryana government is going to start a new Parali Incentive Scheme 2019. In this scheme, the state govt. will provide support of Rs 100/quintal to small and marginal farmers who have not burned stubble in their fields. This amount would only be applicable to non Basmati paddy procured by government. Stubble incentives would be provided through deputy commissioner.
The number of Haryana Parali Incentive Scheme beneficiaries and estimated cost will be known after CM’s clearance. As per an estimate, around 20 lakh farmers in Haryana cultivate on less than 5 acres of land. The government has information of land and bank accounts of all the farmers. The proposal to curb stubble burning is sent to CM Manohar Lal Khattar who will take final decision in this regard.
Supreme Court has lashed out at authorities for failing to curb severe air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region. SC had directed the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to provide support of Rs 100/quintal within seven days to farmers for not burning stubble.

Haryana Parali Incentive Scheme to Curb Stubble Burning
Parali (Stubble) burning has become a major cause of pollution in recent days. Many farmers in Haryana and Punjab burns their stubble in order to get their farm land ready for next season cultivation. The smoke emission from parali burning contains pollutants and is choking nearby state Delhi. The NCT of Delhi is just like gas chamber these days due to harmful levels of Air Quality Index (AQI). 
PM 2.5 & PM 10 levels in national capital are beyond hazardous level due to parali burning. SC has already put a ban on burning of stubble in these 2 states, but the no. of incidents of stubble burning are not reducing. This is because farmers are poor in both Haryana and Punjab states. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The parali machine price is not affordable as it costs around 15 lakh per machine even after getting subsidy from central govt. Moreover, the rent of parali machine is too high for farmers which they cannot afford. So to reduce the level of pollution in Delhi, Supreme Court has ordered Punjab and Haryana state govt’s to provide incentives to farmers.

Haryana government has announced Surcharge Waiver Scheme for electricity bills of tubewells on 3 September 2019. In addition to this, the state govt. also announced to provide relief of 9% to 45% to plot holders of Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) under the Enhancement Recalculation Scheme. This is the next major move after 3 settlement schemes for loanee farmers of cooperative banks.
The state govt. decided to provide relief to tubewell consumers having electricity connections under Surcharge Waiver Scheme & plot holders of HSVP. There are around 6.10 lakh farmers in the Haryana state which have taken electricity connections for the tubewells. 
Out of these farmers, around 2.44 lakh connections have become defaulters and an amount of Rs. 147 crore is outstanding towards them.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Haryana Surcharge Waiver on Tubewells Electricity Bills
In this new Tubewell Surcharge Waiver Scheme in Haryana, if farmers wants to pay their electricity bills then no surcharge amount would be deducted. Previously, farmers had to pay surcharge amount of 20% to 25% of the power bills of tubewells. The surcharge amount would now be waived in case farmers make lump-sum payment of their bils upto 30 November 2019.
Moreover, Tubewells electricity connections of farmers which have been discontinued for less than 2 years on becoming defaulters would be restored. On Enhancement Recalculation Scheme, CM said that earlier plot holders does not gets information on enhancement by HSVP. Due to this, interest on the enhancement amount gets increased.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Previously in July 2018, a 1 time settlement plan with 40% rebate was launched for HSVP plot holders. Under that settlement plan, over 24,000 plot holders deposited around Rs. 853 crore as enhancement amount. In November 2019, another settlement scheme was launched with 37.5% rebate. In that scheme, over 4,000 plot holders paid an enhancement of Rs. 155 crore.
But till date, some plot holders have not paid their enhancement amount even in the previous 2 settlement schemes. The major demand of such plot holders was that the recalculation of enhancement must be done in their sectors. So, the state govt. has made new rules and a separate committee was constituted for recalculation. 
As per the recommendations of this committee, govt. has to perform recalculation of 300 sectors out of which calculation of 12 sectors has already been done. Now all the plot holders are required to deposit the enhancement amount as per this recalculation. As per the new rules, recalculation of each sector is going to be different. So, the plot holders are expected to get benefit ranging from 9% to 45%.

For the first time in the state, all the 4 power companies have emerged from losses and have earned profit. In 2017-18, UHBVN earns a profit of Rs. 278 crore and DHBVN earns profit of Rs. 134 crore. Thus the total earned profits of these 2 companies is Rs. 412 crore. To ensure welfare of farmers, the power tariff has been reduced to almost half (50%). This reduction has considerably resulted in reducing the electricity bills of domestic consumers.

Haryana govt. start implementing this government scheme from 1 January 2018. 
In the initial phase, govt. is going to fix minimum support price for 4 crops – Potato, Onion, Tomato, Cauliflower. The primary objective of this scheme is to ensure that the farmers must not face the distress sale of their produce. Moreover, govt. will fix the base price equivalent to the cultivation cost.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});


Haryana govt. will launch this scheme to ensure that the farmers must get fair price for their vegetables produce.
For this reason, govt. will fix the base price equivalent to the cultivation cost.
Moreover, the state govt. emphasizes on diversification of crops. In addition to this, farmers will get access to the Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) markets to sell their fruits, vegetables and flowers.
Govt. is also planning to adopt peri-urban agriculture for farming purposes.
This type of farming will enable the farmers to earn more money as compared to the traditional farming.
Accordingly, farmers will not have to sell their products at a lower price than the minimum support price. If they have to, then govt. will provide compensation (bharpai) equivalent to the deficit (antar) in the price (bhav).
Furthermore, farmers should produce need based crops in adjoining areas as the agricultural products are likely to decay in a short span of time.

To reduce water consumption and its wastage, the state govt. of Haryana is going to start a new scheme.
Under this new scheme, all the farmers would be encouraged to produce other crops namely maize (makka), arhar (pulses) instead of cultivation of rice (dhaan). In the first phase, the scheme would be implemented in 1 part of 7 major rice producing districts.

Highlights of Bijli Bill Jurmana Maafi Yojana

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The second option is to pay in a maximum of six equal bi-monthly installments payable along with the next 6 bills.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The other point that consumers should note is that the meter already installed in the premises would be replaced by Sub Divisional Officer (SDO) with a new electronic meter within three days. The cost of the meter would be charged from the consumer in case it is supplied by the Power Distribution Company or Nigam. 
While launching Bijli Bill Jurmana Maafi Yojana, the Chief Minister also assured that no checking would be carried out during the period of operation of the scheme (i.e. till December 31, 2016) for consumers having sanctioned load up to 5 KW. Also, no meter having similar load will be seized and sent to the lab for testing in this period. 
To make sure that more and more consumers can take benefit of Bijli Bill Jurmana Maafi Yojana, the Chief Minister has said that the consumers, whose meters have been seized for the verification in the M&T Lab and are pending for testing, will also have the option to avail this scheme. No further testing of the meter and investigation will be done in their case.
The cases of defective meters – including burnt meters, sticky, and dead stop – have also be covered under the scheme. In case any consumer feels that he or she has been treated fairly by the concerned Sub Divisional Officer, he or she can appeal to the concerned Executive Engineer. 
On receiving any such appeal, the concerned authority will have to decide the same within three working days. 
The consumers under the scheme can also avail Surcharge Waiver Scheme- 2016 if eligible for the same.
