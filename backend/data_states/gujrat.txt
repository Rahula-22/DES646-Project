Gujarat is the 1st state to launch a PNG scheme for the AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana) and BPL (below poverty line) category households in selected urban areas across the country.
As the Ujjwala Yojana does not covers the urban AAY / BPl Households, this scheme will supplement Ujjwala Yojana. Initially, around 2.32 lakh urban AAY / BPL households will get benefits with the help of city gas distribution companies and state-owned oil marketing companies during 2018-19.

Along with Gujarat residents, people from other states and even from other countries facing accidents in Gujarat are also applicable for this scheme. Even there is no income criteria attached with this scheme.
The primary objective is to provide timely and best quality treatment to the victims in order to reduce the life risk as first 48 hours are crucial for accident victims.
This scheme will also change the intention of people to shift victims immediately in a govt. hospital which sometimes does not have the quality treatment facilities. Now, people can admit such victims directly into the nearby hospital (either private or govt.) with specialist doctors and other required facilities without caring about expenses.
Ambulance Operators will also be given directions to admit road accident victims in the best hospitals near the location of the place where accident took place.
Private hospitals will not charge upto Rs. 50,000 money for the first 48 hours from the accident victims instead they will get this amount reimbursed from the state govt.

Gujarat govt. is going to implement this scheme as soon as possible. In Gujarat, around 29,300 accidents take place every year out of which around 6,400 results in death of patients. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Providing best possible treatment in a timely manner will help in saving many lives. For this reason, govt. will provide instructions to the private hospitals to start giving free treatment and submit their bills with the officials for reimbursement.

After the official launch in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh on May 1 by PM Nerandra Modi, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana is all set to be launched in the state of Gujarat. The PMUY free LPG connection scheme will be launched by BJP chief Amit Shah and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on 15th May in Gujarat.
The launch event of the scheme will take place in tribal-dominated Dahod district in central Gujarat. The scheme is aimed to provide free LPG connections to 5 crore BPL households in the country. The 8000 crore scheme will be partly funded by the money saved in LPG subsidies through PM Modi’s “Give-it-Up” campaign. IN Gujarat alone, 4.40 Lakh people have chosen to give up the LPG subsidy after the appeal made by PM Narendra Modi.
Dahod district has the lowest percentage of LPG connections across the state, hence it has been selected for the launch ceremony of the Ujjwala Yojana.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Under the PMUY LPG scheme, the central government will provide a financial support of Rs. 1600/- for each LPG connection to BPL household. The cooking gas will not only help reduce the cost of cooking but also help protect health of women and children.
Under the Ujjwala LPG scheme, the subsidy amount of LPG cylinder refill will be transferred to the Jan Dhan bank account of the women beneficiary. The eligible applicants can apply for PM Ujjwala scheme by going to their nearest LPG distributor.

On an average, around 1500 farmers die every year due to the causes covered under this group insurance scheme.

Gujarat government has launched Suryashakti Kisan Yojana (SKY) on 23 June 2018. Under this scheme, farmers can use solar energy for irrigation purposes and can also sell the surplus power via grid. For installation of solar panels, farmers will only have to pay 5% of the total cost. Central & State govt. will provide subsidy of 60% while for the rest 35%, the state govt. will provide low cost loans to the farmers for 7 years.
Farmers can generate power through these solar panels and can sell it to the state government. Govt. will procure electricity at a rate of Rs. 7 per unit for 7 years while at Rs. 3.50 for the remaining 18 years. SKY scheme is expected to cover 12,400 farmers in 33 districts and will provide them with solar power through 137 feeders. 
Latest Update – Gujarat CM launches the ambitious Suryashakti Kisan Yojana on 19 October 2018, a power harvesting scheme for Gujarat farmers from Bardoli. This scheme enables farmers to generate electricity by installing solar panels in their farms for their captive consumption and also earn from selling the surplus power.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Initially, the state govt. will implement the pilot project of solar power generation scheme with an outlay of Rs. 870 crore. To produce 1,42,000 horse power of energy for irrigation through water pumps will require 177 megawatts of solar power generation in the pilot stage.
Suryashakti Kisan Yojana – SKY Scheme in Gujarat
The state govt. has launched the pilot project and will implement this scheme soon in the entire state. Farmers will get included in the next phase. The main aim is to harness the solar energy and to put it in use to generate power. Now farmers can generate electricity and utilize it for irrigation purpose and sell the additional energy via grid. The important features and highlights of this scheme are as follows:- 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});


Solar Panels Purchase Cost – Out of the total cost, farmers will only have to pay 5%. 60% would be given as subsidy amount while 35% would be given as low interest rate loans for 7 years. The loan repayment time is fixed at 7 years.
Selling Additional Power – Farmers can sell the additional power to state government. For first 7 years, govt. will purchase power at a cost of Rs. 7 per unit while govt. will purchase the power at Rs. 3.5 per unit for next 18 years.
This scheme will provide a huge relief to the farmers and will also generate additional income. Farmers will be able to recover the cost of investment within the next 8 to 18 months.
Till date, farmers are getting electricity for 8 hours for irrigation purpose. After the successful implementation of this project, farmers will get electricity upto 12 hours. Moreover, it will also resolve the concerns of farmers of getting power supply only at night.
Extra Earnings for the Govt. – Currently, farmers in Gujarat pay around 50 paise / unit for electricity supply for irrigation purposes. The state government spends about Rs. 4,500 – 5,000 crore per year as subsidy on electricity for irrigation purpose. This subsidy cost can be brought down by proper implementation of SKY Scheme.
Suryashakti Kisan Yojana SKY Gujarat

Govt. is making every possible effort to install 100 giga watts (GW) of energy capacity from solar power till 2022. This move will contribute towards the realization of PM Modi’s vision of “Doubling Farmers Income by 2022”.
