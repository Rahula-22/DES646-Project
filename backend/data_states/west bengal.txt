Drip irrigation and Sprinkle irrigation are 2 important processes which will help in cultivation of more acres of land using less quantity of water. Various trials and tests proves that both these processes are helpful in cultivation of crops with lesser water consumption. CM Mamata Banerjee has received the proposal for this purpose which has now been approved in the cabinet on 12 September 2018.

Drip Irrigation mechanism costs around Rs. 70,000 and Sprinkle Irrigation mechanism will cost around Rs. 20,000 per acre of land. Farmers will get these facilities absolutely free of cost. The state govt. has allocated around Rs. 35 crore for the project.

Experts will develop mechanisms for individual farmers and govt. will also provide necessary support to farmers.
State govt. will make payment to experts after receiving feedback from farmers and proper scrutiny of the same.

The new employment generation projects will help in ensuring the means of livelihood for the unemployed youths in the urban part of the state. At present, there are many scopes present for self employment generation and Karma Sathi Prakalpa will enable youths to take a step ahead in taking up projects to stand on their own feet.
GoWB launches a new scheme ‘Karma Sathi Prakalpa’ for the #youth. 1 lac youth can avail soft loans and other subsidies through this scheme. When the unemployment rate in the country is 24%, an all-time high, Bengal’s unemployment rate has reduced by 40%. #InternationalYouthDay— Banglar Gorbo Mamata (@BanglarGorboMB) August 12, 2020 
As per the proposal, around 3 lakh youths would be brought under Karma Sathi Prakalpa Scheme over the next 3 years. Each year, West Bengal govt. will provide loans of upto Rs. 2 lakhs to more than 1 lakh youths. Loans would be provided through Co-operative banks. Jobless youths can avail this facility to setup small manufacturing and trading activities.
Background
Mamata Banerjee led West Bengal govt. has taken many initiatives in past 9 years to ensure generation of job opportunities. In addition, such initiatives to provide financial assistance are helping youths to take up their own projects. WB Cooperation dept. is already providing required support to self help groups which helps in improving economy in both rural and urban parts of state. Now the unemployed youths in the urban areas would be benefited with Karma Sathi Prakalpa Scheme.
