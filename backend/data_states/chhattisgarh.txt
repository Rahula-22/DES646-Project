शक्ति स्वरूपा योजना 2019 (Chhattisgarh Shakti Swarupa Yojana) को शुरू करने के पीछे छत्तीसगढ़ सरकार का यही मकसद है की राज्य की निराश्रित और बेसहारा महिलाएं ज्यादा से ज्यादा आत्म निर्भर बन सके। क्यूंकि विधवा होने के बाद महिलाओं को समाज में ठीक से जगह नहीं मिलती और उनकी आर्थिक स्थिति भी खराब हो जाती है। छत्तीसगढ़ की शक्ति स्वरूपा योजना महिलाओं को व्यवसाय के क्षेत्र में आने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करेगी।

इस योजना के द्वारा महिलाओ को आत्मनिर्भर बनाने के साथ-साथ जीवन स्तर को उठाने में मदद मिलेगी।

Chhattisgarh government will soon roll out Universal Healthcare Scheme (UHS) 2019. This UHS Scheme would replace the flagship scheme of Modi govt. namely Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) or Ayushman Bharat Scheme. As per the official statement, health services should be the right of citizens such as Right to Information, Right to Work, Right to Food, so UHS needs to be implemented in Chhattisgarh.
The newly elected govt. in the state of Chhattisgarh has made pre-poll promise of launching CG Universal Healthcare Scheme. Now the state govt. said that the UHS Scheme is in pipeline for the citizens to replace PMJAY Scheme. This move will make the state the 1st state in the country to implement universal healthcare scheme. 
TS Singh Deo stated that the new universal healthcare scheme of Chhattisgarh is better than the Ayushman Bharat – PM Jan Arogya Yojana.

Chhattisgarh Universal Healthcare Scheme (UHS) 2019
The state govt. of Chhattisgarh is going to launch Universal Healthcare Scheme (UHS) 2019. This scheme is essential as Ayushman Bharat Yojana (PMJAY) is an insurance-based model. In PMJAY Scheme, tax payers money is given to the insurance companies. In the insurance company based model of implementation, there are some irregularities. The state govt. will provide quality healthcare to people on the basis of their infrastructure through UHS Scheme.
TS Singh Deo has made allegation that treatment of only Rs. 50,000 is covered in Ayushman Bharat Scheme instead of Rs. 5 lakh. In Ayushman Bharat Yojana, OPD treatment of the citizens is not covered and to avail benefits, people needs to get admitted in the hospital for insurance cover. Accordingly, around 70% of the citizens are not covered in this Ayushman Bharat Scheme. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

In Chhattisgarh, UHS scheme only covers Rs. 50,000 and expenses above the limit is provided by the state government. In the tender, there was a premium amount of Rs. 1100 out of which Rs. 660 is paid by the central govt. while the remaining cost is borne by the state government. UHS scheme can be implemented with the existing infrastructure.

— TS Singh Deo (@TS_SinghDeo) March 14, 2019

Universal Healthcare Scheme needs no more infrastructure to provide quality treatment to citizens. The state govt. can provide better healthcare facilities with the current 170 community health centers. Moreover as the requirement for health services increases, the state govt. can increase it with requirement. Every village is being covered by the health workers and has given assurance to provide further assistance.
PM Narendra Modi has inaugurated the first health care center under PMJAY Scheme at Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh on 14 April 2018.
