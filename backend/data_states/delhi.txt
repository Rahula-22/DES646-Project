Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana 2020 List of BeneficiariesDelhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana CertificatesOpposition on Delhi CM Housing Scheme for JJ Cluster ResidentsDelhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana Background
Delhi government has started Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana (CM Housing Scheme) for residents of Jhuggi Jhopadi Clusters on 24 December 2019. The incumbent Aam Aadmi Party govt. led by CM Arvind Kejriwal assures to provide pucca houses to each and every household in Delhi CM Housing Scheme. The state govt. of National Capital of India has distributed certificates to 65,000 families living in slum clusters and these households will soon get pakka houses. People can now check their name in Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana List 2020 at delhishelterboard.in. 
CM Kejriwal said that distributed certificates under Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana 2020 will ensure that Jhuggi Jhopadi are not going to be drowned or occupied in the future. Delhi CM alleges that the previous state govt’s had not done anything for Jhuggi Jhopadi residents.
Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has been given the responsibility to make pucca houses for people residing in Jhuggi Jhopadi clusters.

Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana 2020 List of Beneficiaries
DUSIB Board had started a demand survey in June 2019 to create list of Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana 2020 beneficiaries in Delhi. The board has already identified & named 65,749 Jhuggi Jhopadi residents in Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana beneficiary list 2020. Check the complete list of beneficiaries at delhishelterboard.in. All the JJ cluster residents living in 156 slum clusters whose name appears in CM Housing Scheme list would be provided with pucca houses soon. 
The new Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana in Delhi is a matter of pride, honour and happiness for JJ residents. While CM Kejriwal gave away certificates to few families at Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana launch function in South Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar, the rest would be distributed local MLA’s and officials in next few days. The CM Housing Scheme certificate would ensure that slums would not be broken down and occupied by any govt. authority.

CM said that the survey work was still going on and those families which are left out of the CM Housing Scheme counting process would also be covered soon.

आज 65,000 झुग्गी परिवारों को सर्टिफिकेट दिया गया। बाक़ी सर्वे चल रहा है। झुग्गी के पड़ोस में पक्का मकान बनाकर दिया जाएगा और तब तक उनकी झुग्गी को तोड़ा नहीं जाएगा। दिल्ली के हर नागरिक के लिए इज्जत की जिंदगी मिल सके इसलिए हम हर प्रयास कर रहे हैं। pic.twitter.com/w9UeZmTAOM
— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) December 24, 2019
 
Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana Certificates
The information present in CM Awas Yojana certificates would serve as safety net for Jhuggi dwellers. This info. will ensure that their shanties are not demolished by any govt. agency in the grab of getting the land vacated. The Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana Certificates would contain the following information:- 

Name of head of family
Family photograph
Code number
Survey code number by DUSIB
Voter Identity (ID) card number

These certificates will also ensure that Jhuggi jhopadi residents also get pucca houses of their own. No govt. agency will now demolish any jhuggi and once people get new houses, they can demolish their jhuggi themselves before moving to new houses. 
Opposition on Delhi CM Housing Scheme for JJ Cluster Residents
Opposition alleges that distribution of Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana Certificates is a deliberate attempt to mislead and misguide innocent people just ahead of assembly elections in Delhi. Aam Aadmi Party promised in its 2015 manifesto to provide flats or plots to JJ cluster dwellers within or near their residencies. Today after 5 years of AAP govt in power, distribution of certificates is nothing more than piece of paper.
Though the state govt. had earlier planned to survey all 675 Jhuggi Jhopadi clusters, Delhi Development Authority recently wrote to DUSIB that it will carry out its own assessment of slums that have come out of land belonging to central government agencies.
Delhi CM Housing Scheme Jhuggi Jhopadi Residents 
Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana Background
CM said that he understands the troubles faced by people in slum areas as he himself lived in slums for some time. He lived in jhuggi while working for an NGO. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and CM Kejriwal used to get furious at govt. for being inconsiderate and merciless towards problems faced by JJ residents. Both of them decided to work towards constructing legitimate dwelling spaces for slum dwellers. He also slammed previous govt’s for not working for welfare of slum dwellers and considering them only as vote bank.
The state govt. has already provided pucca houses to 5,000 families and all housesholds are happy since they are getting all basic amenities. The CM Housing scheme certificates are surety of non destruction and non enroachment of slums and surety of getting pucca houses. 
Delhi government has also issued their report card on quality education and free health services and termed their tenure as excellent.

दिल्ली की कैबिनेट ने मुफ्त वाई फाई योजना को दी मंजूरी, अब सार्वजानिक स्थानों पर सभी लोग कर सकेंगे फ्री वाई फाई सविधा का उपयोग, हर व्यक्ति को एक महीने में मिलेगा 15 जीबी इंटरनेटDelhi government is going to start Free Wi-Fi Scheme at public places in the national capital. It is going to be the largest Free Wifi project running anywhere in the world. The work on setting up 11,000 hotspots across Delhi is in progress. On 16 December 2019, around 100 hotspots will be inaugurated to mark official launching the Delhi government’s free WiFi scheme. The state govt. will also start Delhi Free Wifi Scheme App download facility to connect to the wi-fi network.
The state govt. of Delhi has fulfilled its commitment to provide free wi-fi services to people at public places. All the Delhiites will get free 15 GB data per month through a hotspot network across the city. This is one of the 70 promises made by the AAP party ahead of the 2015 assembly elections.
The cabinet committee led by CM Arvind Kejriwal has also approved proposal to install an additional 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras across the city. The expenditure finance committee of Delhi government had approved both the projects on 9 August 2019.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Delhi Free Wifi Scheme App Download
Delhi govt. is working on a project to create more than 11,000 hotspots across the city. All the users within the radius of 50 metres are going to access internet absolutely free of cost. Each user will get 15 GB data monthly (1.5 GB / day) at a speed of 100 to 150 mbps with maximum 200 mbps under Delhi Free Wifi Scheme 2019. The state govt. will also launch Delhi Free Wifi App can be downloaded through which users can upload their KYC (know your customer) details. An OTP will be received to activate the Wi-Fi connection. 
At bus queue shelters, around 4,000 hotspots would be setup while the rest 7,000 will be installed in markets, residential colonies and other places with each constituency getting 100. The first 100 hotspots will be set up at Kashmere Gate Metro station and ISBT, ITO bus stand, Mandi House bus stand, Delhi Secretariat, Indraprashtha Metro station, and Adarsh Nagar (18), Badali (19), Moti Nagar (10), Seemapuri (16) and Shahdara (18) Assembly constituencies. The switch over from one hotspot to other will be automatic.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Delhi Free Wi-Fi Scheme Implementation
After the inauguration of the first batch of 100 hotspots on December 16, 500 hotspots will be set up every week and in the next six months, all 11,000 hotspots will be in place, he said. Around 150 to 200 users would be able to access internet concurrently at each hotspot. The state govt. will learn from its experience of 1st phase of Free Wi-Fi Scheme and will create more hotspots (if necessary) in subsequent phases. 
Delhi Free Wifi Scheme 2019 is going to be run on OpEx (operating expense) service model. The complete capital investment in setting up the infrastructure would be made by the vendor. The state government will bear the operating cost of approx. Rs. 100 crore per annum. The Wi-Fi scheme is based on a rent model and the government will pay monthly rental for each hotspot to a company handling the project.
In order to check the misuse of Free Wi-Fi facility, CM said that the state govt. will ensure that adequate safety measures will be taken. Although most mobile phone users have internet access on their phones, youths are still asking questions on when they will start getting free Wi-Fi facility. So, the govt. is working hard to speed up the project.
Delhi Free Wifi Scheme Public Places
The Wi-Fi hotspots are also going to be connected with the CCTV cameras being installed across the city. The response of general public regarding cameras is overwhelming positive. However, the BJP party has terme the announcement of providing free Wi-Fi and installation of additional CCTV cameras in 2nd phase as poll stunt.

Delhi Mukhyamantri Solar Power Scheme (MSPS)Compensation Policy for Martyrs FamilySupport to NGOs
Delhi cabinet has approved Mukhyamantri Solar Power Scheme (MSPS) to promote rooftop solar systems by providing subsidy and generation-based incentive (GBI) to domestic consumers. Under this revised rooftop solar scheme in Delhi, all residents who install rooftop solar panels will get subsidy on their electricity bills and GBI of Rs. 2 per unit for a duration of five years. 
Under the Renewable Energy Service Company [RESCO] model, domestic consumers need not spend any money from their pocket to install solar panels but it will be done by the selected service providers. Also the disbursal of GBI will now be on half-yearly basis instead of annually by discoms. The state government will pay the distribution companies in the form of compensation for the GBI disbursed.
Under Mukhyamantri Solar Power scheme (MSPS), all the group housing societies does not have to bear the installation costs as it would be borne by the company. All the housing societies would now get a subsidy of Rs. 2 per unit from the state govt. meaning that cost of power would now be Rs. 1 per unit as the total cost initially would be Rs. 3 per unit.

Delhi Mukhyamantri Solar Power Scheme (MSPS)
Under this revised rooftop solar power scheme in Delhi, the state govt. will provide GBI of Rs. 2 per unit and subsidy on electricity bills. Service providers will pay the amount for installation of solar panels on the houses of domestic residents under RESCO model. 
The cost of power to consumers could reduce further and may even become zero if housing society has more space to offer the company to install panels. This subsidy amount would even apply to rooftop solar systems installed on individual homes as well under Mukhyamantri Solar Power Scheme (MSPS). However in such cases, the initial cost of the installation needs to be borne by the home owner or the company as per their agreement.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Delhi government is already running the rooftop solar subsidy scheme for the past 3 years but this time a payment security aspect has been introduced for vendors. If any consumer defaults on the electricity bill, then the subsidy would be paid by the govt. directly to the companies.
Delhi Revised Rooftop Solar Scheme
Till date, the solar power capacity of around 100 megawatts (MW) had been installed in Delhi. Out of this power, around 5MW of power is in the domestic sector with 8 to 10 group housing societies and some individual consumers. Out of the total allocated budget of Rs. 10 crore in 2016-17 and Rs. 20 crore in 2017-18, only Rs. 2.84 lakh in 2016-17 and Rs. 50 lakh in 2017-18 has been disbursed.
Compensation Policy for Martyrs Family
Cabinet committee has also approved the proposal of revenue department to extend the scheme for grant of compensation to families of martyrs. Previously, Rs. 1 crore compensation was given to families of armed forces, Delhi police and paramilitary forces martyrs who were Delhi residents or had died in operation in Delhi. Now this scheme would also cover families who are residents of Delhi for the past 5 years even in case their service record specifies that they belongs to some other state.
This amendment was essential after the latest incident of brutual murder of head constable Narendra Kumar of BSF at international border b/w India and Pakistan. The family of Narendra Kumar was residing in Delhi for many years though their permanent address is of Haryana state. 
Support to NGOs
Cabinet committee has also approved scheme to offer monetary aid to NGOs to mark the death / birth anniversaries of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Sant Ravidas and Maharishi Balmiki. For this, a sum of Rs. 50,000 would be given for each such event.

Delhi govt. is going to launch a new Loan Scheme for Safai Karamcharis. Under this scheme, the state govt. will provide loans to manual scavengers (safai karamchari) to buy new sewer cleaning machines. Any worker can get this machine at just 10% of the total machine cost and can earn upto Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 per month.
The primary objective of this loan scheme is to eliminate death risks of manual scavengers, raising their living standards and lead them to a dignified life. Moreover, these loans will also create a clean and safe environment to the people residing in National Capital – Delhi.
In the first phase, the state govt. will hire 220 machines. Every machine requires 4 persons to operate it. So, this will result in additional job opportunities. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Delhi Loan Scheme for Safai Karamcharis / Manual Scavengers – Sewer Cleaning Machines
All the workers (not contractors) who are engaged in manual scavenging activities or who cleans sewers can now take loans from the state govt. to buy Sewer Cleaning Machines. The important features and highlights of this Delhi Govt. Loan Scheme 2018 for manual scavengers are as follows:- 

Need for Manual Scavengers Loan Scheme – This decision comes after the recent death incidents where at-least 12 workers have been killed during cleaning sewers or septic tanks in Delhi since August 2016. So, this initiative will put an end to manual scavenging and thus will reduce deaths caused while cleaning sewers. Now all the safai karmis will no longer have to dig deep into the manholes risking their lives.
Number of Manual Scavenging Machines – Delhi Jal Board will procure 220 specialised machines which a workers can take on contract for 7 years. The state govt. will act as facilitator. This Delhi Govt. Loan Scheme will rehabilitate safai karamcharis or manual scavengers.
Cost of Sewer Cleaning Machines – One question still arises that how workers will be able to procure their own machines that can cost upto Rs. 38 lakh. SBI would provide 75% of the total machine cost at 11% per annum. SC / ST corporations will provide 15% of the total cost at 10% per annum. Remaining cost is to be borne by the individual. Govt. will provide them loans for procurement of specifically designed sewer cleaning machines and will turn them into entrepreneurs.
Earnings for Safai Karamcharis – To successfully implement this scheme, govt. must keep a check on the people who purchases these machines. All the workers who takes these machines on contract can earn b/w Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 per month for 5 months after deduction of the entire loan amount.
Other Measures – Govt. is also focusing on releasing new scavenging guidelines which needs to be followed by malls, hospitals and hotels.

Govt. will also pay special attention to the dependents of safai karamcharis who have lost their lives on duty i.e while cleaning sewers. Delhi govt. is also planning to launch other initiatives to ensure proper sewage systems and waste management techniques.

This scheme will ensure that all roads, streets and signals are beggar free and will also ensures that beggars are able to earn at-least Rs. 250 per day for their livelihood.

Delhi Vocational Training Scheme for Beggars
Begging is a major problem in the capital region as even small children are forced to beg on streets and signals for food. This spoils their childhood and deprive them of education as well. This scheme will ensure that the beggars give up begging for food. The important features and highlights of this scheme are as follows:-

Delhi govt. is planning to launch this training course for beggars to enable them to earn their livelihood.
Now Govt. will provide them training on tailoring, handicraft and other skills to lead them towards a better life.
Govt’s Plan –

All the beggars enrolled in this training course will get Rs. 250 per day.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Begging – An offense in Delhi and Mumbai
Begging is an offense in both Delhi and Mumbai. All the people involved in this illegal profession may be detained, trained and eventually employed elsewhere. Under Prevention of Begging Act, a child below the age of 16 years and girls below the age of 18 years are prohibited from begging.
In case the beggars found guilty by the Court, then they can be sentenced to minimum 1 year of imprisonment and max. 3 years in Beggar’s Home. Moreover, the dependents of beggars are also liable to get punished.
This scheme is a good step of the govt. in the right direction to make Delhi Beggar-Free. If implemented successfully, this scheme can permanently cure India’s homelessness.
Previous Begging Tackling Scheme – Background
Under the law, govt. often picks up beggars from signals, roads, streets and send them to government homes. But this is not a permanent solution for this major problem as beggars ends up on streets again.
Before the Commonwealth Games in FY 2010, Delhi govt. had taken an intense drive to send them to govt’s home but lack of resources naturally meant they had to be let go. So, Delhi govt. is bringing this new scheme and is going to place this scheme before cabinet very soon.

Accordingly, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) headed by LG has finally approved 3 proposals to amend Master Plan 2021 – Increasing Floor Area Ratio (FAR), Reducing the Conversion Charges and lastly, regularization of Agricultural Godowns.
This move of DDA is expected to provide huge relief to the traders from the on-going sealing drive for commercial establishments.

Delhi Sealing Drive – DDA 3 New Proposals
Delhi Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Anil Baijal (also DDA Chairman) has presided over the meeting to take decisions to tackle this sealing drive. The decisions taken in this meeting includes these 3 proposals:-

Raising Floor Area Ratio (FAR) – The decision includes the extension of floor area ratio of Local Shopping Complexes (LSC) from current 180 to 300.
Reduction in Conversion Charges Penalities – Other important decision is to reduce the penalities for non payment of conversion charges from existing 10 times to only 2 times.
Regularization Of Agricultural Godowns – Govt. will regularize godowns constructed on 12 metre wide roads.

Shop owners in Delhi are now holding state wise protests against this sealing drive. Businessman has extended their full support for two day bandh organized by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) against recent sealing of shops. Around 8 lakh shops and factories will participate in this protest and Delhi Market will remain shut for next 2 days.

CAIT is getting support for bandh from all shops, traders, businessman and factories across all parts of Delhi. Moreover, govt. will focus on legalizing 4th floor of sealing hit areas. Furthermore, there is increasing demand from CAIT to allow basement to get used for commercial activities.

Implementation of Mobility Card for Public Transport
This mobility Card project was proposed in the year 2010. Earlier the state govt. decided to launch this scheme in July 2016, but the implementation of the Mobility Card Project got delayed. Subsequently, the state govt. has carried out various trials to test the functioning of mobility cards in the DTC buses. 
Delhi govt. has tried this facility in Phase III project and now they are going to install a machine on their buses. Accordingly, now their systems are capable to accept the mobility cards. Henceforth, DTC will install several ETMs in the buses. This machine will read the cards and will also process the receipts.

Delhi government has started implementing Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana in the national capital from 30 December 2019. In this CM Street Light Scheme, the state govt. will install around 2.1 lakh street lights to light up dark spots. This scheme is a major step towards strengthening of women safety. The 3 DISCOMS will have the responsibility of installing these street lights and each Discom will install 70,000 street lights.
Just like installation of CCTV cameras in Delhi, the state govt. will follow the same process to install street lights. The street lights will even be put outside people houses under Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana 2019 in Delhi.
The new scheme of installation of street lights by Delhi government will bypasses the role of the MCD. CM Street Light Scheme will provide solution to problems which people faces in dark stretches in the city.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Delhi CM Street Light Scheme 2019
The three Discoms of Delhi will have the responsibility for installation and maintenance of street lights. Under Delhi Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana, the installation would be of 20 to 40 Watt LED lights. The tender process for Delhi CM Street Light Scheme 2019 will also include a warranty clause of 3 to 5 years. CM Street Light Yojana will have an investment of Rs. 100 crore for installation of street lights and Rs. 10 crore per annum subsequently.
The state govt. of Delhi is committed to ensure that not even a single dark spot is left in the state. All the lights installed under CM Street Light Scheme will be automatic and will even contain sensors. People would be able to submit their requests for street lights to their local MLAs. After placing requests, the permission of building owners will be taken. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Upon receiving permission, the street lights will get installed after the location of survey is passed by the power company. It is expected that the selection process for location of street lights will be completed before November 2019. The building owner’s household connection will power the street lights. 
The state govt. of Delhi will decide how much electricity is needed to run 1 light. The same electricity cost will be deducted from electricity bills of people as it is an automatic arrangement. Delhi CM Street Light Scheme will ensure that the entire state is covered with street lights. In unauthorized colonies and slum areas, there was lack of space and MCDs were refusing to give NOCs to setup street lights. To tackle this issue, the state govt. has launched Delhi Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana.
Now with the launch of this CM Street Light Scheme, only the permission of MLA and building owner would be required. People can now get these lights installed outside their house, shop and street. Till date, there are around 7 lakh street lights in Delhi and now 2 lakh more street lights will be installed. Delhi Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana is the first plan in the world in which tender of 30% of current street light capacity is being launched.

After providing huge relief to Delhi citizens in electricity bills & water bills, CM Arvind Kejriwal has announced a new Power Subsidy Scheme for Tenants. Delhi government has announced Mukhyamantri Kirayedaar Bijli Meter Yojana. This scheme will benefit a large number of people who are residing in flats on rental basis or in houses in colonies on rent.
Under Delhi CM Kirayedaar Bijli Meter Yojana, govt. will install prepaid meters for tenants. These new meters would be setup only for domestic use at the rented accommodations. To avail the benefits of CM Power Subsidy Scheme for tenants, people will have to deposit Rs. 3,000 as security amount and Rs. 3,000 for line drawing.
These prepaid electricity meters will reduce the power bills of tenants as they have to pay more amount to the house owners.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Delhi Mukhyamantri Kirayedaar Bijli Meter Yojana
In Delhi, tenants were unable to get benefits of power subsidy as landlords used to ask more money from persons living on rent. Now the state govt. has started CM Kirayedaar Bijli Meter Yojana to provide benefits of power subsidy to tenants. Delhi govt. will install prepaid meters to enable people on rented accommodations to keep a check on their electricity bills.
Delhi people are getting 24*7 supply of electricity at lowest prices in the country. Previously, tenants had to take permission from house owners to install meters. Now people can install prepaid meters for themselves without any requirement for No Objection Certificate (NOC). To avail prepaid meters from companies, people can call on the following numbers – 19122 (BSES Yamuna), 19123 (BSES Rajdhani), 19124 (Tata).


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Just like there is recharge for Dish TV, fees for prepaid meters will be required to be paid in advance. In case the total energy consumption is less than 200 units, then it is free i.e no amount would be charged from tenants. For electricity consumption b/w 200 to 400 units, the electricity bills would be reduced to half.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal: Government has come up with a scheme for tenants 'Mukhyamantri Kirayedaar Bijli Meter Yojna' under which prepaid meters will be installed at rented accommodations, this is applicable for domestic use only. pic.twitter.com/S5btM0rHtD

All the tenants will have to deposit security amount of Rs. 3,000 to install pre-paid meters. For this purpose, rent agreement or any slip of rent needs to be produced.

In this scheme, students who wants to get admission in prestigious colleges or universities can take the benefits of credit facility or education loans.

There were many talented students in Delhi who were unable to pursue higher education courses due to financial crunch. As per a report, around 67% dwellers in Delhi consumes less than 200 units of power per month. So, it is evident that a significant population of Delhi is poor and requires government assistance. Delhi govt. education loan scheme for higher studies is aimed at masses who aspires and qualify to enroll in prestigious professional courses.
Delhi Student Credit Facility Scheme will ensure that eligible candidates get loans from the banks to pursue higher education and skill development programmes. The state govt. has instructed participating banks to cascade the details of the loan scheme to every single branch and employee for enhanced support and disbursal. Moreover, all the prominent displays would be put at each branch premises in Delhi in order to raise awareness about the facility.
More than 4,25,000 students from total 5 lakh students studying in Delhi colleges are residents of the national capital. Banks would provide full coverage to substantial student base to provide them assistance in all forms to pursue higher education.

Mukhyamantri will also write a letter to his counterparts in other states like West Bengal, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh & Karnataka to follow suit. 
CM will fight with the central government to get it implemented across the country. If MPs, MLAs of our country who works for 40 days gets pension for lifetime, then why not the employees who works for 40 precious years of their life gets the pension. 
The pension is the right of each and every employee and the govt. will ensure that employees gets the pension.

Revival of Old Pension Scheme for Government Employees in Delhi
The employees forms a very important part of the government and have the power to even change the government of the country. Delhi CM slammed the new pension scheme as betrayal and cheating with the government employees. He wants that the Old Pension Scheme needs to be restored and so this decision will be passed in the special session of Delhi legislative assembly. Central govt. cannot accomplish the task of nation building by disappointing the govt. employees. 
Delhi govt. has performed well in the areas of education, health, power and water supply due to consistent cooperation and support of its employees. The new pension scheme was introduced by the central government in FY 2004. Under the New Pension Scheme, employees contribute towards pension from their monthly salary and the same amount of contribution is made by the employer. Pension fund managers then invests the funds in the earmarked investment schemes.

Mukhyamantri of Delhi accuses PM Modi of creating hurdles in his work and in the functioning of Delhi government. So, CM would fight with the central government to implement the Old Pension Scheme which is a long term demand of the employees.

दिल्ली सरकार ने समाज कल्याण विभाग के प्रस्ताव को मंजूरी देते हुए व्यावसायिक प्रशिक्षण योजना के अंतर्गत वार्षिक पारिवारिक आय की सीमा को 1 लाख रूपये से 3 लाख रूपये कियाDelhi govt. has increased the annual family income criteria for vocational training scheme. Delhi cabinet has approved the proposal of Social Welfare Department (SWD) to enhance the annual family income criteria by Rs. 2 lakh under Vocational Training Scheme. VTS yojana aims to impart training to scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribes (ST), other backward classes (OBC), minorities and physically handicapped persons.
The cabinet committee of Delhi approves SWDs proposal for enhancement in annual family income criteria from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh. SC / ST / OBC / Minority Vocational Training scheme is implemented by the DSFDC corporation. 
As per the latest Delhi govt., highest minimum wages is Rs. 17,916 per month or Rs. 1,14,992 per annum. So, the higher cost of living in Delhi is considered as a reason behind this raising of Family Income Criteria. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Delhi SC / ST / OBC / Minority Vocational Training Scheme
The DSFDC corporation was not able to sponsor sufficient number of students to these 2 training institutes due to lower family income criteria. The committee setup by the govt. for SC / ST / OBC / Minority Vocational Training Scheme suggested that annual family income should be raised from existing Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh. But the cabinet has raised the annual family income limit from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh.
The DSFDC corporation is implementing Vocational Training Scheme to impart job oriented vocational courses. People belonging to target groups like SC / ST / OBC / Minority get this vocational training to develop their skills and knowledge in a particular trade. This makes them self reliant for wage employment as well as self employment.

Delhi govt. is providing funds as grant-in-aid for implementation of Vocational Training Scheme. The state govt. is providing training through 2 govt. institutes – Apparel Textiles Design Center (ATDC) and National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC).

Delhi government is going to provide Rs. 1,000 per year to each student in Class XI and XII in state govt. run schools. In addition, govt. will provide Rs. 5,000 to each government college students as seed money under its Entrepreneurship Curriculum. This new move of the government will tackle the problem of unemployment by teaching entrepreneurship to students. 
This new scheme of Delhi govt. will enable students to get knowledge about leadership skills and will turn them into entrepreneurs. The main focus is to make students job creators rather than job seekers. 
Education Minister Manish Sisodia has given information about this decision on 13 February 2019.

Delhi Entrepreneurship Curriculum 2019
The new move of the Delhi govt. to provide Rs. 5,000 per year to government college students will encourage students to start business ventures. In order to turn them into entrepreneurs, students would be taught to take risk in business. If only 1% of government school / college students goes on to become entrepreneurs, then India will surely become a superpower. Previously, the state government had introduced happiness curriculum which is often praised by the foreign delegates.
The Delhi Entrepreneurship Curriculum is also going to have the same impact. Ironically, the state govt. is providing degree to students but whenever there is a clerk job, hundreds of PhD scholarship makes online registrations and apply for that jobs. This situation arises only due to the lack of knowledge and the students are unable to figure out what is best suitable for them.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The entire country is suffering from the lack of employment opportunities and with each passing day, the number of job seekers are increasing rather than job creators. All the school children wants to get jobs rather then becoming employment generators. This thought process can be solved by the new Delhi Entrepreneurship Curriculum.
Delhi govt. is consistently working hard to create more employment opportunities which is the true patriotism. This new entrepreneurship curriculum will help children let their fear go and do something creative in order to eventually create jobs for thousands of people. 
The state govt. is going to allocate upto Rs. 50 crore in the budget in the next financial year in order to enable students to get seed money to generate new ideas of business plan. Any entrepreneur is the person who believes in themselves and has ability to gather resources and solve problems. 
The new Entrepreneurship Curriculum is not going to focus on any business or job oriented skill. However, this curriculum will equip learners with a mindset to help choose any profession they want to get in.
