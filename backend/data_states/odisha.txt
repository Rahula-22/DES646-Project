Under this scheme, all the women will get access to hygiene products along with employment opportunities in every district of the state. This scheme of Union govt. will be a counter of the state-run Khushi Scheme in which govt. provides free sanitary napkins to female students of govt. and govt. aided schools in the state. 
In 1st phase of Ujjwala Sanitary Napkin Initiative, oil marketing companies will setup around 100 local manufacturing units. OMCs will setup these units at common service centers (CSCs) across 93 blocks in 30 districts in Odisha. Common Service Centres (CSCs) are facilities which are set up to deliver govt. e-services in rural and remote locations.
As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report, the overall usage of sanitary napkins in Odisha is 33.5% which is quite low. So, central govt. wants to make usage of sanitary napkins into a mass movement.

All the women will first receive training in manufacturing and sale of sanitary napkins. This initiative will provide opportunities to women to earn between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 15,000 per month. This scheme is going to make women self reliant as the previous measures of distributing money to women through revolving funds is insufficient.

Scheme for UPSC Civil Service Coaching Odisha – Background
For a long time, there was an urgent need for a state sponsored Centre for Administrative and Academic Career development for youth from Odisha. These youths includes all the students who completed their graduation and post graduation degree from universities and are looking for a career in administrative jobs in civil services, banks, insurance sectors or in private sectors. But the success rate of graduates from Odisha universities in national level competitive examinations without any preparatory training was lower.
So, the students had to travel to Delhi to prepare for Civil Service examinations. In Delhi, students get access to quality library and private coaching centres having good and dedicated teachers. For poor but talented students of Odisha, getting training in New Delhi by spending huge amount of fees and living expenses is difficult. So, the state govt. tries to tackle this problem by funding high quality training centres in universities.
Though these centres will take some time to stabilize, so govt. felt an urgent need of selection of coaching centre which can impart quality training in a focusses manner. Moreover, the coaching center must have credential of imparting effective coaching for UPSC civil service exam and whose success rate must also be high. So, DHE Odisha has selected M/s Dhyeya IAS, New Delhi after following a transparent tender process. The coaching center has been established in Bhubaneswar in order to ensure that Odia students gets coaching opportunity in their home State.
