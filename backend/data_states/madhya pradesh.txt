Madhya Pradesh govt. has started Selfie With Toilet Scheme 2019 under Mukhyamantri Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana. Under this scheme, if groom takes a loo selfie then bride will get Rs. 51,000 as marriage gift. This is one pre wedding photo shoot which no one wants to remember. Application forms for MP CM Kanya Vivaah / Nikaah Scheme would be accepted only after the bride proves that her husband’s house has a toilet.
It is now a mandatory requirement to take Selfie With Toilet to avail assistance of Rs. 51,000 under CM Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana in MP. As govt. officials cannot go to each house and check loos everywhere, they now demands #selfie-standing-in-toilet from groom. 
The idea of grooms being required to prove that they have toilet before marrying is not bad thing. Social Justice department has not issued any such directive and implementation of policy can be better.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

MP Selfie With Toilet Scheme – CM Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana
The clause of Toilet is present since the launch of MP Mukhyamantri Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana in 2013 but photographs are recent addition. Previously, there was relaxation in policy and grooms were told to build a toilet within 30 days of marriage. But now the Selfie With Toilet Scheme is compulsory for all grooms and brides to avail Rs. 51,000 as marriage gift.
There is nothing wrong in attaching photo of groom in toilet as it is not a part of wedding card. This case gets worse in case the bride lives in another city or district. The local govt. officials did not approves the marriage till groom provided proof of him standing in toilet. The toilets are an intrinsic part of Swachh Bharat Mission of central government.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The grooms are at receiving end of this cleanup mission and there could be some more graceful way of asking grooms to prove they have toilets.
MP Selfie With Toilet Scheme Bride Groom
MP Mukhyamantri Kanya Vivah / Nikah Scheme is applicable for economically weaker sections (EWS) category people. On 18 December 2018, the state govt. led by CM Kamal Nath had hiked financial assistance from Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 51,000. This has led to a large number of applications which makes it difficult for officials to access each house for toilets.

MP govt. will encourage cooperative marketing committees, agricultural producer organizations, public sectors, private institutions and businessmen not to purchase onions from farmers at price less than Rs. 800 per quintal.
It is observed that on the arrival of onion in Madhya Pradesh, the prices falls in Mandis while on the other hand farmers gets good prices of onion in big cities like Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Kolkata and Ranchi. So to provide adequate prices to farmers for onion produce, the state govt. has launched MP CM’s Onion Incentive Scheme.
Henceforth, all the traders who buys onion for more than Rs. 800 / quintal and sell it in Mandis outside the state would be given grant upto 75% of expenditure on transport and storage.

MP Chief Minister’s Onion Incentive Scheme 2019
The state govt. of Madhya Pradesh has announced to provide fair rates to farmers for onion produce under MP Chief Minister’s Onion Incentive Scheme 2019. Now, all the buyers (traders) will not be able to purchase onions at less than Rs. 800 per quintal. Moreover, traders who buy farmers for price higher than Rs. 800 per quintal and sell onions in Mandis outside the state will get 75% grant of expenditure on transport and storage.
In addition to this, in case the state co-operative marketing committees or agricultural producers organization sell the onion purchased from farmers outside the MP state, then such organizations would get cent percent compensation of cost of transport and storage.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Despite all these efforts, in case all prices fall below Rs. 800 per quintal in the market in May and June months, then the difference amount b/w model selling price of fixed mandis and support price of Rs. 800 / quintal would be directly credited to the bank accounts of farmers. To avail this difference amount, farmers must be registered and must have sell onions during this period alone.
CM Kamal Nath urges all the farmers to not to bring their entire onion for sale in market. This is because as the farmers brings their entire produce in the market, then it causes unnecessary pressure on onion prices (price fall). So, farmers must only sell onions of the amount which they require at the time of arrival of crop. Accordingly, farmers can simply store the remaining produce of onions. This move will not have any impact on the prices of onions in the Mandis and the farmers will get fair prices of their crop.

In these canteens, the dishes are offered at extremely affordable prices like idli at just Rs. 1 and plate of curry leaves rice at Rs. 5.

Farmers can make online registration from 28 July to 31 August 2018 at mpeuparjan.nic.in
The primary objective of this Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana is to raise farmers income in case of distress sale. In case the kharif crops are being sold at lower price than MSP in markets, then they can apply for BBY Scheme to get their loss covered. 
Market Prices of 13 Kharif Crops are found to be lower than MSP this FY 2018, so the govt. has taken this step to restart MP BBY Scheme 2018.

How Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana Works
This is a frequent question in the minds of the people that “How Bhavantar Bhugtan price Deficit Scheme Works”. Here we are telling you the price deficit mechanism. Let us suppose that MSP for maize is Rs. 3,000 per quintal and the modal rate is Rs. 2,500 and:-
— If farmers sells the crop at Rs. 2,700 per quintal in mandi, govt. will pay out Rs. 300 (Rs. 3000 – Rs.2700) per quintal directly to bank account of farmers.
— In case the farmers sells crop at Rs. 2,300 per quintal, then the state govt. will provide only Rs. 500 (Rs. 2300 – Rs. 2500) per quintal for crops sold. 
Madhya Pradesh Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY) – Background
BBY Scheme was firstly launched by MP govt. in October 2017 to sustain the falling farm prices. Govt. had launched this scheme in order to provide financial support to the farmers in case of distressed sale in mandis. This year also, there are a lots of distressed sales, so the govt. will resume this scheme for Kharif crops. The online booking will start from 28 July 2018 and will continue till 31 August 2018. For more details, visit the official website – http://mpeuparjan.nic.in/mpeuparjan/Home.aspx
BBY Scheme is a farmer friendly scheme and needs consistent monitoring, inspection and mission mode implementation. Moreover, govt. will focus on exporting these crops in order to ensure that farmers gets more price than MSP price. Currently, market price of moong is Rs. 5,000 per quintal and MSP is Rs. 6,925. For arhar, market price is Rs. 3,900 per quintal and MSP is Rs. 5,650 per quintal. This scheme is a major step towards “Doubling Farmers Income by 2022”.
