This scheme aims to improve the level of health and education in women and bringing a positive change in the mindset towards them. UP Kanya Sumangla Scheme 2019 is based on the Ladli Laxmi Yojna of the previous BJP led Madhya Pradesh government. 
In UP Kanya Sumangla Yojana, pre-determined amount would be deposited at the regular intervals in the name of girl child to aid her education and marriage. This amount would be transferred direcly into the bank account of the girls through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode. The drop out rate of the girls would also be reduced through this scheme.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

UP Kanya Sumangla Yojana 2019
The UP Kanya Sumangla Scheme is going to be implemented from 1 April 2019 and the scheme details are yet to be worked out. CM Yogi Adityanath stated that a pre-determined amount will be deposited in the bank accounts of girl child at the following durations:-

1st Installment at the time birth of girl child
2nd Installment at the time of vaccination
3rd Installment at the time of admission of girls in Class I
4th Installment when a girl reaches class VI
5th Installment when a girl reaches class IX
6th Installment at the time the girl starts graduation
7th Installment at the time of girl’s wedding

The state govt. will ensure that the girls would get handsome amount by the time she graduates or get married. This scheme of UP govt. will work in collaboration with the central govt’s “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” scheme. Previously, Akhilesh led UP govt. had started Kanya Vidya Dhan Scheme in which all the girls who clears the intermediate under UP board were given one time assistance of Rs. 30,000. This Kanya Vidya Dhan Scheme was later extended to girls passing out from Madrassas.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Mayawati led BSP govt. in Uttar Pradesh had 2 schemes for girl child namely Mahamaya Garib Balika Ashirvad Yojana and Savitri Bai Phule Balika Shiksha Madad Yojana. This schemes were launched to ensure that girls are no longer a burden on the families and needs to be sent to school. 
Various other state govt’s like Bihar has started distributing cycles to school girls to encourage them to attend schools regularly. UP Kanya Sumangla Yojana draws its inspiration from MP Ladli Laxmi Yojana which offers annual National Savings Certificate of Rs. 6,000 in the name of beneficiaries. This is followed by the fixed amount deposits at regular intervals till the time the girls got graduated or got married. This amount is paid as a lump sum amount through DBT mode in girls bank accounts.
However, it is still not clear how application forms would be invited for UP Kanya Sumangla Yojana and how much amount each girl would get. The details are still being worked out which is to be put before cabinet and the scheme has to be implemented from 1 April 2019.

उत्तर प्रदेश सरकार द्वारा शुरू की गई इस सरकारी योजना में निराश्रित, बेसहारा गोवंश का पालन करने वाले किसानों को 30 रुपये प्रतिदिन प्रति पशु के हिसाब से पैसे दिये जाएंगेUttar Pradesh govt. has approved a new Chief Minister Destitute Cow Participation Scheme. Under this scheme of UP govt., each person who adopts 1 stray cattle will get Rs. 30 per day. This is because existing cow shelters are over-flowing with animals. Yogi Adityanath decides to put up 1 lakh such cows for public adoption. The state govt. will transfer Rs. 900 per month to bank account of willing persons who take home a cow.
Each such animal which is adopted would be ear-tagged for identity purposes under UP CM Destitute Cow Participation Scheme. Earlier in 2019, farmers in UP had taken up arms and protested over stray cattle destroying their fields. This is an aftermath of decision of ban on illegal slaughter of cattle in Uttar Pradesh.
There were various instances of farmers locking up stray cattle in govt. schools and offices which led to UP govt. to order opening of new cow shelters in every district. The UP govt. is paying Rs. 900 every month to upkeep each cattle to cow shelters too. 



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Yogi Govt. to Pay Rs. 30 / Day on Adopting Stray Cattle
As the cow shelters are overflowing with more than 10 to 12 lakh cattle and there are reports of cows dying due to neglect. So, UP govt. has approved a new Chief Minister Destitute Cow Participation Scheme. In this scheme, all the willing farmers, dairy farmers or common people can adopt a cow from existing shelters and take animal home.
In the 1st phase of adopting stray cattle scheme, govt. will hand over 1 lakh cattle to such members of public. UP govt. is going to transfer Rs. 900 per month to bank account of each such farmer for up-keep and nutrition of animal. The District Magistrates are going to identify such “willing adopters”. 


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

The state govt. of Uttar Pradesh will spend Rs. 109 crore on this exercise annually. In order to avail the scheme benefits, person who adopts the animal cannot sell or let loose / abandon the animal. The UP govt. will setup committee in each district to monitor exercise and each such animal handed over would be ear tagged. This ear tagging is to be done for identity and subsequent monitoring.
The UP government has the “potential to create employment and increase social participation”. This would increase the income of farmers and would reduce the extent of stray cattle in UP. In the subsequent phases, more cow can be put up for adoption depending upon initial success.

योगी आदित्यनाथ की उत्तर प्रदेश सरकार अब गुड समारितन स्कीम २०१९ करेगी लांच, इस योजना में सड़क या रेल दुर्घटना के घायलों को अस्पताल पहुँचाने वालों को 2,000 रुपये नकद मिलेंगेUttar Pradesh govt. is planning to launch UP Good Samaritan Scheme 2019. Under this scheme, incentives of Rs. 2,000 would be given to those who brings injured people (in road / rail accidents) to hospitals. Yogi Adityanath Good Samaritan Scheme’s main focus is on ensuring that each injured person gets treatment on time. Moreover, this scheme will encourage people to help road accident victims.
This Good Samaritan Scheme of UP govt. comes after the recent Bus Accident of Mainpuri in which 17 people died after driver loses control on wheels. Final decision on the Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme 2019 is yet to be taken. 
Road Safety Council is working on encouraging people to help victims of accident.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

UP Good Samaritan Scheme 2019 by Yogi Adityanath
After an increase in the number of road accidents in UP, Yogi Adityanath govt. works on a new policy to provide cash incentives to good samaritans. All those people who comes forward to help and take injured people to hospitals for treatment will get Rs. 2,000. The proposal for Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme has been sent and the scheme is expected to start in the next 2 or 3 months.
Previously, the state govt. has formulated policy to protect Good Samaritan which is existing since January 2016, but it is not enough. This move of providing Rs. 2,000 will minimize deaths from road accidents and make medical assistance available to victims within the crucial golden hour (1st hour after accident).


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Bystanders, who assist road accident victims already enjoys legal protection from police and hospital questioning and other legal hassles under the good Samaritan law. This law was made by the central government made after Supreme Court judgment in 2014.
Delhi, Gujarat, Odisha, Karnataka and Maharashtra already have Good Samaritan Scheme. Every state follows a different procedure to provide cash incentives to volunteers, so UP govt. has to lay down a procedure before official launch of scheme. The state govt. is expected to earmark Rs. 50 lakh for funding the Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme. 
However, the money will come from the Road Safety Fund and not the state govt’s budget. UP has lesser number of road accidents but the highest number of deaths. The major reason is that people doesn’t assist victims and a large number of injured persons lacks timely hospitalization. Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme in UP will encourage and motivate volunteers to help the injured ones.

UP Pension Schemes to Cover 14 lakh More Beneficiaries
UP govt. has asked the officials for the extension of pension facility to over 14 lakh persons who inspite of fulfilling the required norms were unable to get the govt. schemes benefits.

Why Samajwadi Rozgar YojanaAssistance under Samajwadi Rozgar YojanaSustainability of the schemeScope of Employment Under Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana
Keeping in mind the huge unemployed population in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana has been developed. The Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana will help develop small traders and generating jobs for the unemployed in the state.
Why Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana
Almost everyone is aware about the state of unemployment in the country despite of people being academically qualified in different skills. In such scenario, most are looking for jobs to make their living while many are looking to start their own business.
Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana is expected to help both job seekers and small traders & developing organizations in a big way. Under the scheme, the government will financial help small traders and organizations grow more and generate jobs for the youth.



(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Assistance under Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana
Under the scheme, the person who owns Rs. 1 Lakh is eligible to start a business worth Rs. 25 Lakh. The rest of the financial assistance will be provided by the state government. As per scheme, the government would provide 90 per cent of the margin money. Undoubtedly, this is one of the greatest features of the scheme and a reason of joy for those not able to start their own business because of lack of finance.
Sustainability of the scheme
The scheme clearly states that only the person who owns Rs. 1 Lakh is eligible to get a financial assistance of up to Rs. 25 Lakh. But, it may be difficult for the small traders, farmers, craft workers and jobless in rural areas to accumulate Rs. 1 Lakh to be eligible for the scheme. This may be considered a reason why the scheme is not sustainable at a large scale in the state. However, accumulating Rs. 1 Lakh for the residents in urban areas may not be a big thing, hence the scheme shall be more popular there.


(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});

Another reason why the scheme may not be so successful in rural areas is the lack of skills, knowledge or experience required to create and successfully run a business.
Scope of Employment Under Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana
Once the scheme is able to successfully develop small enterprises, there are vast chances that jobs will be created at different levels for the unemployed. According to some estimates, if the scheme is able to create 1000 startups each employing 50 people on average, 50000 people will get jobs. It will be a big push to the overall development of the people and the state itself.
However, the scheme is a great initiative of the state Government but to make it successful, people also need skills, knowledge and experience to create and run any kind of business. Finding people with such good skills and knowledge may be difficult may be the reason scheme may need some amendments.
Earlier the project was to be named as Chief Minister Rozgar Yojana but later it was re-christened as Samajwadi Rozgar Yojana giving it a Socialist tinge. It would be part of other Samajwadi schemes like Samajwadi Pension Yojana, Samajwadi Awas Yojana and Samajwadi Ambulance Sewa.
